### Hello, and welcome to my GitHub

Most of my repos are in language-specific organizations, rather than [github.com/xdg](https://github.com/xdg):

* Go code: [github.com/xdg-go](https://github.com/xdg-go)
* Perl code: [github.com/dagolden](https://github.com/dagolden)
* Forks of others' repos: [github.com/xdg-forks](https://github.com/xdg-forks)

<!--
**xdg/xdg** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
