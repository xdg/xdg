### Hello, and welcome to my GitHub

I'm an expert software engineer, with over 25 years experience programming.  See my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidagolden/) for more.
You'll find my [writing](https://xdg.me/writing/) and [conference talks](https://xdg.em/talks/) on my website, [xdg.me](https://xdg.me/).  I'm [@xdg](https://twitter.com/xdg) on Twitter, too.

Most of my repos are in language-specific organizations, rather than [github.com/xdg](https://github.com/xdg):

* Go code: [github.com/xdg-go](https://github.com/xdg-go)
* Perl code: [github.com/dagolden](https://github.com/dagolden)
* Forks of others' repos: [github.com/xdg-forks](https://github.com/xdg-forks)
